# The tragedy of the transposons
Code and data for manuscript by Nicholas G. Davies, J. Arvid Ã…gren, Kevin R. Foster.

# Guide to the repository

`Cost-Benefit/` contains intermediate files processed by `cost_benefit_load.R` from data files in `Deterministic/Runs/4-Analysis/`.

`Deterministic/` contains the one-type and two-type deterministic transposon simulation code.

`TE/` contains the stochastic individual-based transposon simulation code.

The code in `Deterministic/` and `TE/` is written in C++ and can be compiled with `make`.

Other files in the top level are R scripts and intermediate data files generated by those scripts, which mainly have to do with generating figures for the manuscript. These were run using R `4.3.2`.
